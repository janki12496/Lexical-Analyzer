# Lexical-Analyzer
This is a simple implementation of lexical analyzer using C.

This is a program for token specification and recognition. For example, Separation of keywords from identifiers, identifying a set of operators etc. Basically, techniques used for lexical analysis are useful in many programming application other than compilers. Lexical analyzers are pattern recognition engines. I have mainly worked on identifying tokens for a subset of C language constructs.
